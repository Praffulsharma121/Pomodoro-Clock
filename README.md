# Pomodoro-Clock

It is a productivity clock based on the Pomodoro Technique.

Built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Functionalities-

* Customize Session and break times.
* Sound alert when the current session or break starts and ends.
* After work sessions the clock will default to break time.
* You will have to set Session time and Break time manually (how long you want your Session and break time).

It is an intentional design choice and the user must press the "start" button to start every session. The clock won't move on the next session automatically, it means the user have to reset the session time and break time again (after every cycle). When the Session finish the break time starts automatically after a sound alert.
